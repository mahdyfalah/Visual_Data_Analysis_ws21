In this assignment We implement a simple bar chart of the U.S states GDP
the task consists of reading the data from a csv file, creating x and y axis,
plotting the bars based on the data on the graph and lastly labeling the axis and
the data points.
a grid on the y axis is additionally plotted for better comparison.
simple knowledge of html were also required for this task.
to keep the assignment clean, I have created different folders for data, script(
which contains d3 file) and the css.
comments are also provided in index.html file for better explanation of the code.
